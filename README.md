## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built from scratch to classify images of **cats, dogs, and wild animals**. The model was trained using **Google Colab** and achieved an impressive **97.8% accuracy**!

## 🚀 Features
- **Built from Scratch**: No pre-trained models, just a pure CNN architecture.
- **Residual Blocks**: Used to improve gradient flow in deeper networks.
- **Batch Normalization & Dropout**: Helps in stabilizing and regularizing training.
- **Data Augmentation**: Increases dataset diversity for better generalization.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **97.8% classification accuracy**.

## 📊 Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Layers** with ReLU activation
- **Batch Normalization** to speed up training
- **Residual Blocks** for deep feature learning
- **Dropout Layers** to prevent overfitting
- **Fully Connected Layers** for classification

## 🏆 Results  
- **Accuracy**: 97.8%  
- **Loss**: Minimal overfitting due to batch norm & dropout

## 📂 Dataset
- Custom dataset containing **cats, dogs, and wild animals**
- Images resized from **512x512 to 32x32** for training efficiency
